# Types of AI Models

**Icon:** category

AI models are grouped by *how they learn* and *what they produce*. The interactive tree view below shows the landscape at a glance.

| Type | Core idea | Learns from | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Symbolic / Rule-based** | Human-written rules and logic | Expert knowledge | Explainable, deterministic, safe | Brittle, doesn't scale, no learning |
| **Statistical / Discriminative** | Learns decision boundaries | Labeled data (probability) | Accurate, efficient, interpretable | Needs labels, poor at open-ended tasks |
| **Generative** | Learns the data distribution, samples new data | Next-token / pixel / latent prediction | Creates text, images, code, audio | Can hallucinate, expensive to train |
| **Predictive / Time-series** | Learns trends and sequences | Temporal / regression data | Forecasting, anomaly detection | Sensitive to noise, limited to tabular/time |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Learns actions via reward signals | Trial-and-error + feedback | Optimal policies, game play | Sample-inefficient, reward design hard |
| **Neuro-symbolic / Hybrid** | Neural nets + symbolic reasoning | End-to-end + explicit logic | Best of both, explainable | Complex, research-heavy, immature |

**Golden rule:** no model is universally best. Use symbolic for safety-critical logic, discriminative for fast classification, generative for open-ended creation, and LLMs when you need language understanding *and* generation in one system.
